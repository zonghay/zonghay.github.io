## AboutMe

I am a backend development engineer, graduated from Harbin Engineering University, and currently live in Beijing.

The purpose of creating this space is to organize my learning and thoughts into systematic articles. Writing is also a process of "reading extensively and intensively."
Using this as a record, looking back on these articles years later may reveal my naivety and inexperience at this time.

### Hobbies

- Playing football (soccer) in my free time ⚽️
- Playing basketball in my free time 🏀
- Occasionally watching movies 🎬 
- Occasionally exercising self-discipline 
- Occasionally attending performances

### Work Experience

- 2018-2021 TAL Education Group
- 2022-Present FunPlus
