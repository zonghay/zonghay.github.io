So, I set up a simple environment on my MAC to run a small demo. I already had Nginx and PHP, just had to configure an Nginx vhost and it should be done, but who knew I’d spend half a day messing with the vhost. Tough times.\nSince all my previous Nginx configurations were done on virtual machines provided by the company, it was just a matter of copying a conf file from a previous project, changing the root path and server_name, and then reloading.\nHaving read the Nginx manual, I understood the roles of the http, server, and location modules, as well as some configurations, so I decided to write one myself.\nFirst, I wrote a test.php file in /Users/zonghay/www/, and then configured the vhost to see the effect.\nMy first server configuration was as follows:\nserver { listen 8848; server_name localhost; location / { root /Users/zonghay/www/; index index.html index.htm; } } Accessing http://localhost:8848 in the browser, I encountered a 404 error. A 404 error means something couldn’t be found. But what exactly? After thinking for a while, I realized that I wrote a test.php file, but the Nginx configuration was looking for index.html and index.htm. I quickly changed the PHP file name and updated the Nginx configuration file to this:\nserver { listen 8848; server_name localhost; location / { root /Users/zonghay/www/; index index.html index.htm index.php; } } Restart Nginx and send a request. This time it wasn’t a 404, but a blank page, and instead of displaying anything, it downloaded the index.php file. Eh, why is that? After a Bing search, I found out that when Nginx matches the index.php file, it realizes it’s not an HTML resource, so it returns the file with a content-type of application/octet-stream. We can see the HTTP response in the F12 developer tools.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx/1.17.3 Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2019 13:25:25 GMT Last-Modified: Wed, 13 Nov 2019 13:23:34 GMT Content-Type: application/octet-stream Content-Length: 18 ETag: “5dcc03d6-12” Accept-Ranges: bytes\nBut how to solve this? Of course, you need to tell Nginx to hand over the file to someone else for processing. So, let’s continue building the wall, add a location block to match PHP files, and tell Nginx to hand the file over to PHP-FPM listening on port 9000 of the local machine.\nserver { listen 8848; server_name localhost; location / { root /Users/zonghay/www/; index index.html index.htm index.php; } location ~ .*\\.php$ { fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; } } Continue with the restart and refresh.\nWith full of anticipation, I found that it was neither a 404 nor a download this time, but a blank page. I was devastated. But after calming down and analyzing it, why didn’t it return anything? It could be that PHP-FPM didn’t process the file or didn’t process it correctly, returning empty. After carefully comparing my virtual machine’s vhost configuration with this season’s configuration, I realized I might have made a basic mistake. As we all know, what is the full name of PHP-FPM? It’s called PHP Fast-CGI Manager, an application that implements the Fast-CGI protocol. You tell Nginx to process the file, but you don’t tell it what protocol to use. It’s like going to a restaurant, carrying meat and asking them to stir-fry a dish, but if you don’t say what dish, they’ll definitely ignore you. So, I Binged and compared the differences between the two configuration files, and wrote a final version.\nserver { listen 8848; server_name localhost; root /Users/zonghay/www/; index index.html index.htm index.php; location ~ .*\\.php$ { include fastcgi_params; fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; fastcgi_index index.php; } } The included fastcgi_params file contains the necessary K-V key-value pairs for the Fast-CGI protocol. As for the functions of these key-value pairs, I will write another article after I finish researching the Fast-CGI protocol. Finally, my little demo ran successfully with some scares, but seeing the words “Hello World” on the screen, I felt quite embarrassed. I’ve been working for a year, and I can still make such a basic mistake in Nginx configuration.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been studying the specifics of the Fast-CGI protocol and used TCPDUMP to capture the TCP packets sent from Nginx to PHP-FPM. So, I set up a simple environment on my MAC to run a small demo. I already had Nginx and PHP, just had to configure an Nginx vhost and it should be done, but who knew I&rsquo;d spend half a day messing with the vhost. Tough times.</p>
<p>Since all my previous Nginx configurations were done on virtual machines provided by the company, it was just a matter of copying a conf file from a previous project, changing the root path and server_name, and then reloading.</p>
<p>Having read the Nginx manual, I understood the roles of the http, server, and location modules, as well as some configurations, so I decided to write one myself.</p>
<p>First, I wrote a test.php file in /Users/zonghay/www/, and then configured the vhost to see the effect.</p>
<p>My first server configuration was as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>server {
        listen       8848;
        server_name  localhost;
       
        location / {
            root  /Users/zonghay/www/;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
}
</code></pre><p>Accessing http://localhost:8848 in the browser, I encountered a 404 error.
A 404 error means something couldn&rsquo;t be found. But what exactly? After thinking for a while, I realized that I wrote a test.php file, but the Nginx configuration was looking for index.html and index.htm. I quickly changed the PHP file name and updated the Nginx configuration file to this:</p>

        location / {
        	root  /Users/zonghay/www/;
        	index  index.html index.htm index.php;
        }
}
</code></pre><p>Restart Nginx and send a request.

<p>But how to solve this? Of course, you need to tell Nginx to hand over the file to someone else for processing. So, let&rsquo;s continue building the wall, add a location block to match PHP files, and tell Nginx to hand the file over to PHP-FPM listening on port 9000 of the local machine.</p>

As we all know, what is the full name of PHP-FPM? It&rsquo;s called PHP Fast-CGI Manager, an application that implements the Fast-CGI protocol. You tell Nginx to process the file, but you don&rsquo;t tell it what protocol to use. It&rsquo;s like going to a restaurant, carrying meat and asking them to stir-fry a dish, but if you don&rsquo;t say what dish, they&rsquo;ll definitely ignore you. So, I Binged and compared the differences between the two configuration files, and wrote a final version.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>server {
        listen       8848;
        server_name  localhost;
        root  /Users/zonghay/www/;
        index  index.html index.htm index.php;

        location ~ .*\.php$ {
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
        }
}
</code></pre><p>The included fastcgi_params file contains the necessary K-V key-value pairs for the Fast-CGI protocol. As for the functions of these key-value pairs, I will write another article after I finish researching the Fast-CGI protocol. Finally, my little demo ran successfully with some scares, but seeing the words &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; on the screen, I felt quite embarrassed. I&rsquo;ve been working for a year, and I can still make such a basic mistake in Nginx configuration.</p>
